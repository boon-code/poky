<title>Using the Extensible SDK</title>

<para>
    This chapter describes what you need on your machine in order to use
    an extensible SDK.
    The chapter does not repeat information that also applies to using the
    standard SDK.
    The chapter also includes procedures of tasks you can perform using
    an extensible SDK.
    <note>
        The tasks you can perform using a standard SDK are also available
        using an extensible SDK.
        For information on using the standard SDK, see the
        "<link linkend='sdk-using-the-standard-sdk'>Using the Standard SDK</link>"
        chapter.

    <title>Setting Up to Use the Extensible SDK</title>

    <para>
        Here is a list of items I think need addressed in this section:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>Cover differences in the development
                that might be impacted because they are using an extensible
                SDK</emphasis></para>
                <para>Presumably, the various development scenarios are
                covered regarding setup in the previous chapter.
                Are these impacted because the developer is going to now be
                using an extensible SDK?
                If so, what are the implications?
                </para></listitem>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>What new recommendations exist now that
                the developer is going to be using an extensible SDK?</emphasis></para>
                <para>We should cover the most common development scenarios
                that apply when using an extensible SDK.
                Is there a recommended development flow we want to present
                when using an extensible SDK?
                What conditions in a development scenario warrant use of
                the extensible SDK as compared to the standard SDK?
                </para></listitem>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>What procedures do we want to cover to set
                up the extensible SDK?</emphasis></para>
                <para>Is it just a matter of building out the SDK using
                <filename>bitbake -c populate_sdk_ext</filename>?
                Is there a pre-built extensible SDK laying around they can
                find and download if they are using a machine that does not
                have YP installed, which would prevent them from building their
                own SDK?
