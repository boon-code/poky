<title>Customizing the SDK</title>

<para role='writernotes'>
    This chapter is going to cover the details on extending the SDK through
    user customizations.
    I am not sure if this is possible for both the standard and extensible
    SDK or what.

<para role='writernotes'>
    I do not have a feel for what sub-topics need to be covered here.
    I need to get this information from Paul.
