    <title>Manual Development Notes for Scott and Paul</title>

    <para role='writernotes'>
        This chapter is going to cover details about the installed SDK and perhaps
        stuff on locating it (e.g. the naming scheme used to identify the
        <filename>.sh</filename> installation script.
    </para>

    <para role='writernotes'>
        The idea here is to gather all the current information in the regular
        YP doc set that describes how to locate, download, or build out the SDK.
    </para>

    <para role='writernotes'>
        One thing that needs discussed is any differences between getting the
        standard SDK as compared to the extended SDK.
        Do we have pre-build extensible SDKs laying around?
        Where do we get any pre-built SDKs from?
        Show the methods by which the user builds out the SDK?

    <title>Installed Standard SDK Directory Structure</title>

    <para>
        The following figure shows the resulting directory structure after
        you install the Standard SDK by running the <filename>.sh</filename>
        SDK installation script:
    </para>

    <para>
        <imagedata fileref="figures/sdk-installed-standard-sdk-directory.png" scale="60" align="center" />
    </para>

    <para>
        The installed SDK consists of an environment setup script for the SDK,
        a configuration file for the target, a version file for the target,
        and the root filesystem (<filename>sysroots</filename>) needed to
        develop objects for the target system.
    </para>

    <para>
        Within the figure, italicized text is used to indicate replaceable
        portions of the file or directory name.
        For example,
        <replaceable>install_dir</replaceable>/<replaceable>version</replaceable>
        is the directory where the SDK is installed.
        By default, this directory is <filename>/opt/poky/</filename>.
        And, <replaceable>version</replaceable> represents the specific
        snapshot of the SDK (e.g. <filename>&DISTRO;+snapshot</filename>).
        Furthermore, <replaceable>target</replaceable> represents the target
        architecture (e.g. <filename>i586</filename>) and
        <replaceable>host</replaceable> represents the development system's
        architecture (e.g. <filename>x86_64</filename>).
        Thus, the complete names of the two directories within the
        <filename>sysroots</filename> could be
        <filename>i586-poky-linux</filename> and
        <filename>x86_64-pokysdk-linux</filename> for the target and host,
        respectively.
    </para>
