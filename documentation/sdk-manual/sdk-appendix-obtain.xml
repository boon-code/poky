<title>Obtaining the SDK</title>

<para>
    This chapter is going to cover the details on getting the SDK on your
    system.
    It is debatable as to whether or not this should be an appendix.
    It could be part of a main chapter I think.
    Originally suggested by Paul that it should be an appendix.
    I have a sub-section in the main chapters to cover this should we
    decide to place it there.
</para>

<para>
    The idea here is to gather all the current information in the regular
    YP doc set that describes how to locate, download, or build out the SDK.
</para>

<para>
    One thing that needs discussed is any differences between getting the
    standard SDK as compared to the extended SDK.
    Do we have pre-build extensible SDKs laying around?
    Where do we get any pre-built SDKs from?
    Show the methods by which the user builds out the SDK?
</para>
